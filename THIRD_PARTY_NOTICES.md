# Third-party notices

This application uses open-source components under their respective licenses.
The production dependency set is exact-pinned in `package-lock.json`; bundled
license comments are retained in the browser artifact. Every release build also
generates `dist/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` from the esbuild metafile and copies the
full license text for every package that contributes browser code. The build
fails if any contributing package lacks a distributable license file.

Reviewed exact license copies for `@opensea/sdk` 12.1.0 and
`@opensea/seaport-js` 4.3.0 are retained in `third_party_licenses/` because
they are part of the secondary-market integration boundary.
